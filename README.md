## Flutter vs React native

**Community Support** - Growing flutter community and continous support from google

**Performance** - Flutter complies the code to the native code but react native uses javascript layer for compiling

**Third party libraries** - React pure relies on third party tool eg widget testing flutter provides its own library to test perform widget unit testing

**Documentation support** - Better document to learn and develop apps

**Code reusability** - With the support of widgets, code reusability is much more efficient and result-oriented in the case of Flutter app development.

**UI Consistency**: Flutter is more acceptable for rendering identical UI designs for the two popular mobile platforms – iOS and Android

**Shorter Time-to-Market**: As mentioned earlier, Flutter promises a shorter development time and thus is better than React Native in this regard. (Automatically)
